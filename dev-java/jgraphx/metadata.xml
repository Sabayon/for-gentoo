  JGraph X is based on the mxGraph architecture, a re-designed core
  based on JGraph experience.
  Overall, JGraph X provides more features that JGraph, with a far
  smaller code size and complexity. Redesigning the codebase from
  scratch now means implementing common feature extensions are easier
  and require less coding. A number of new loosely coupled
  application-centric features have been added, making prototyping
  even faster, without their usage restricting application
  flexibility.
