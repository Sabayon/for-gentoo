  Charm is a program for OS X, Linux and Windows that helps to keep
  track of time. It is built around two major ideas - tasks and
  events. Tasks are the things time is spend on, repeatedly. For
  example, ironing laundry is a task. The laundry done for two hours on
  last Tuesday is an event in that task. When doing laundry multiple
  times, the events will be accumulated, and can later be printed in
  activity reports or weekly time sheets. So in case laundry would be
  done for three hours on Wednesday again, the activity report for the
  "Ironing Laundry" task would list the event on tuesday, the event on
  wednesday and a total of five hours.
